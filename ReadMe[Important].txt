Dear NOOB user!

First of all before using hydra.py you have to make some installation on both Linux and Windows:
1- python installation [if not installed on windows]
2- pip installation
3- tqdm installation
4- ffmpeg installation
then run hydra.py

Dear Linux user:
 You have to use file hydra-linux.py and create a virtual environment to run the program:
     Command lines:
          -Navigate to desired direcory:e.g. cd /mnt
          -Create a virtual environment:
                   sudo python3 -m venv /mnt/yt-dlp-env
          -Activate the virtual environment:
                   source /mnt/yt-dlp-env/bin/activate
          -Ensure that the directory and its contents are owned by your user:
                   sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /mnt/yt-dlp-env
          -Install the packages again [If needed]:
                   pip install yt-dlp tqdm
          -Running your Python script:
                   python3 /home/[USER]/Downloads/Hydra/hydra-linux.py  [Replace it with your PC path]

For furthure execution:
-Navigate to desired direcory:e.g. cd /mnt
-Activate the virtual environment: source /mnt/yt-dlp-env/bin/activate [replace your path]
-Running your Python script:python3 /home/[USER]/Downloads/Hydra/hydra-linux.py   [replace your path]                                                   
                                                                                                      
                                                                                                               Regards!
