Dear NOOB user!

First of all before using hydra.py you have to make some installation on both Linux and Windows:
1- python installation [if not installed on windows]
2- pip installation
3- tqdm installation
4- ffmpeg installation
then run hydra.py

Dear Linux user:
 You have to use file hydra-linux.py and create a virtual environment to run the program:
     Command lines:
          -Create a virtual environment:
                   python3 -m venv ~/yt-dlp-env
          -Activate the virtual environment:
                   source ~/yt-dlp-env/bin/activate
          -Running your Python script:
                   python3 /home/user/Downloads/Hydra/hydra.py  [Replace it with your PC path]
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                     Regards!
